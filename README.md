# Features

   Real-time Eye Tracking: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track eye movements in real-time.

   Cursor Control: Maps eye movements to mouse cursor movements using PyAutoGUI.
 
   Click Gestures: Supports left-click and right-click actions through predefined eye gestures (e.g., blinking or prolonged gaze).

   Customizable Sensitivity: Adjustable parameters for cursor speed and gesture detection thresholds.

   Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Technologies Used
OpenCV: For real-time video processing and eye detection.

MediaPipe: For facial landmark detection and eye tracking.

PyAutoGUI: For simulating mouse movements and clicks.

Python: The core programming language for the project.
