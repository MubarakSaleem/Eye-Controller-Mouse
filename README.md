# Eye-Controller-Mouse
An innovative hands-free mouse controller powered by eye movements, built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. This project enables users to control their computer cursor using their eyes, providing an accessible solution for individuals with limited mobility

Features:

   >Real-time Eye Tracking: Utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track eye movements in real-time.
   >Cursor Control: Maps eye movements to mouse cursor movements using PyAutoGUI.
   >Click Gestures: Supports left-click and right-click actions through predefined eye gestures (e.g., blinking or prolonged gaze).
   >Customizable Sensitivity: Adjustable parameters for cursor speed and gesture detection thresholds.
   >Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
